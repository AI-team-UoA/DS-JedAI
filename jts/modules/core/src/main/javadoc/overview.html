  <BODY>
    The JTS Topology Suite (JTS) is an open source Java software library that provides an object model for planar geometry together with a set of fundamental geometric functions. 
	JTS conforms to the Simple Features Specification for SQL published by the Open GIS Consortium.  
	JTS is designed to be used as a core component of vector-based geomatics software such as geographical information systems. 
	It can also be used as a general-purpose library providing algorithms in computational geometry.
