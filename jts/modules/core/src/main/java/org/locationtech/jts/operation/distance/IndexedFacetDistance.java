/**
 * Computes the distance between the facets (segments and vertices) 
 * of two {@link Geometry}s
 * using a Branch-and-Bound algorithm.
 * The Branch-and-Bound algorithm operates over a 
 * traversal of R-trees built
 * on the target and the query geometries.
 * <p>
 * This approach provides the following benefits:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Performance is dramatically improved due to the use of the 
 * R-tree index
 * and the pruning due to the Branch-and-Bound approach
 * <li>The spatial index on the target geometry is cached
 * which allow reuse in an repeated query situation.
 * </ul>
 * Using this technique is usually much more performant 
 * than using the brute-force {@link Geometry#distance(Geometry)} 
 * when one or both input geometries are large, 
 * or when evaluating many distance computations against 
 * a single geometry.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe.
