/**
 * An interface for strategies for determining the location of split points on constraint segments.
 * The location of split points has a large effect on the performance and robustness of enforcing a
 * constrained Delaunay triangulation. Poorly chosen split points can cause repeated splitting,
 * especially at narrow constraint angles, since the split point will end up encroaching on the
 * segment containing the original encroaching point. With detailed knowledge of the geometry of the
 * constraints, it is sometimes possible to choose better locations for splitting.
