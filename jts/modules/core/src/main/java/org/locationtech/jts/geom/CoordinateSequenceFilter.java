/**
 *  An interface for classes which process the coordinates in a {@link CoordinateSequence}. 
 *  A filter can either record information about each coordinate,
 *  or change the value of the coordinate. 
 *  Filters can be
 *  used to implement operations such as coordinate transformations, centroid and
 *  envelope computation, and many other functions.
 *  {@link Geometry} classes support the concept of applying a
 *  <code>CoordinateSequenceFilter</code> to each 
 *  {@link CoordinateSequence}s they contain. 
 *  <p>
 *  For maximum efficiency, the execution of filters can be short-circuited by using the {@link #isDone} method.
 *  <p>
 *  <code>CoordinateSequenceFilter</code> is
 *  an example of the Gang-of-Four Visitor pattern.
 *  <p> 
 * <b>Note</b>: In general, it is preferable to treat Geometrys as immutable. 
 * Mutation should be performed by creating a new Geometry object (see {@link GeometryEditor}
 * and {@link GeometryTransformer} for convenient ways to do this).
 * An exception to this rule is when a new Geometry has been created via {@link Geometry#copy()}.
 * In this case mutating the Geometry will not cause aliasing issues, 
 * and a filter is a convenient way to implement coordinate transformation.
