/**
 * Unions MultiPolygons efficiently by
 * using full topological union only for polygons which may overlap,
 * and combining with the remaining polygons.
 * Polygons which may overlap are those which intersect the common extent of the inputs.
 * Polygons wholly outside this extent must be disjoint to the computed union.
 * They can thus be simply combined with the union result,
 * which is much more performant.
 * (There is one caveat to this, which is discussed below).
 * <p>
 * This situation is likely to occur during cascaded polygon union,
 * since the partitioning of polygons is done heuristically
 * and thus may group disjoint polygons which can lie far apart.
 * It may also occur in real world data which contains many disjoint polygons
 * (e.g. polygons representing parcels on different street blocks).
 * 
 * <h2>Algorithm</h2>
 * The overlap region is determined as the common envelope of intersection.
 * The input polygons are partitioned into two sets:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Overlapping: Polygons which intersect the overlap region, and thus potentially overlap each other
 * <li>Disjoint: Polygons which are disjoint from (lie wholly outside) the overlap region
 * </ul>
 * The Overlapping set is fully unioned, and then combined with the Disjoint set.
 * Performing a simple combine works because 
 * the disjoint polygons do not interact with each
 * other (since the inputs are valid MultiPolygons).
 * They also do not interact with the Overlapping polygons, 
 * since they are outside their envelope.
 * 
 * <h2>Discussion</h2>
 * In general the Overlapping set of polygons will 
 * extend beyond the overlap envelope.  This means that the union result
 * will extend beyond the overlap region.
 * There is a small chance that the topological 
 * union of the overlap region will shift the result linework enough
 * that the result geometry intersects one of the Disjoint geometries.
 * This situation is detected and if it occurs 
 * is remedied by falling back to performing a full union of the original inputs.
 * Detection is done by a fairly efficient comparison of edge segments which
 * extend beyond the overlap region.  If any segments have changed
 * then there is a risk of introduced intersections, and full union is performed.
 * <p>
 * This situation has not been observed in JTS using floating precision, 
 * but it could happen due to snapping.  It has been observed 
 * in other APIs (e.g. GEOS) due to more aggressive snapping.
 * It is more likely to happen if a Snap-Rounding overlay is used.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE: Test has shown that using this heuristic impairs performance.
 * It has been removed from use.</b>
 *
