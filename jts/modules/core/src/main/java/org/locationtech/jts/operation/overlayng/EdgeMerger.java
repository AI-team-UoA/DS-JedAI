/**
 * Performs merging on the noded edges of the input geometries.
 * Merging takes place on edges which are coincident 
 * (i.e. have the same coordinate list, modulo direction).
 * The following situations can occur:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Coincident edges from different input geometries have their labels combined
 * <li>Coincident edges from the same area geometry indicate a topology collapse.
 * In this case the topology locations are "summed" to provide a final
 * assignment of side location
 * <li>Coincident edges from the same linear geometry can simply be merged 
 * using the same ON location
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The merging attempts to preserve the direction of linear
 * edges if possible (which is the case if there is 
 * no other coincident edge, or if all coincident edges have the same direction).
 * This ensures that the overlay output line direction will be as consistent
 * as possible with input lines.
 * <p>
 * The merger also preserves the order of the edges in the input.
 * This means that for polygon-line overlay
 * the result lines will be in the same order as in the input
 * (possibly with multiple result lines for a single input line).
