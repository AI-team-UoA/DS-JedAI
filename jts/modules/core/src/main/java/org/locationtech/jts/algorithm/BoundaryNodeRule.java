/**
 * An interface for rules which determine whether node points
 * which are in boundaries of {@link Lineal} geometry components
 * are in the boundary of the parent geometry collection.
 * The SFS specifies a single kind of boundary node rule,
 * the {@link Mod2BoundaryNodeRule} rule.
 * However, other kinds of Boundary Node Rules are appropriate
 * in specific situations (for instance, linear network topology
 * usually follows the {@link EndPointBoundaryNodeRule}.)
 * Some JTS operations 
 * (such as {@link RelateOp}, {@link BoundaryOp} and {@link IsSimpleOp})
 * allow the BoundaryNodeRule to be specified,
 * and respect the supplied rule when computing the results of the operation.
 * <p>
 * An example use case for a non-SFS-standard Boundary Node Rule is
 * that of checking that a set of {@link LineString}s have
 * valid linear network topology, when turn-arounds are represented
 * as closed rings.  In this situation, the entry road to the
 * turn-around is only valid when it touches the turn-around ring
 * at the single (common) endpoint.  This is equivalent 
 * to requiring the set of <tt>LineString</tt>s to be 
 * <b>simple</b> under the {@link EndPointBoundaryNodeRule}.
 * The SFS-standard {@link Mod2BoundaryNodeRule} is not 
 * sufficient to perform this test, since it
 * states that closed rings have <b>no</b> boundary points.
 * <p>
 * This interface and its subclasses follow the <tt>Strategy</tt> design pattern.
