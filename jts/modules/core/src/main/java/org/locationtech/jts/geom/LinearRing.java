 * Models an OGC SFS <code>LinearRing</code>.
 * A <code>LinearRing</code> is a {@link LineString} which is both closed and simple.
 * In other words,
 * the first and last coordinate in the ring must be equal,
 * and the ring must not self-intersect.
 * Either orientation of the ring is allowed.
 * <p>
 * A ring must have either 0 or 3 or more points.
 * The first and last points must be equal (in 2D).
 * If these conditions are not met, the constructors throw
 * an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 * A ring with 3 points is invalid, because it is collapsed
 * and thus has a self-intersection.  It is allowed to be constructed
 * so that it can be represented, and repaired if needed.
