/**
 * Finds and builds overlay result lines from the overlay graph.
 * Output linework has the following semantics:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Linework is fully noded</li>
 * <li>Nodes in the input are preserved in the output</li>
 * <li>Output may contain more nodes than in the input (in particular, 
 * sequences of coincident line segments are noded at each vertex</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Various strategies are possible for how to 
 * merge graph edges into lines.
 * <ul>
 * <li>This implementation uses the simplest approach of
 * maintaining all nodes arising from noding (which includes
 * all nodes in the input, and possibly others).
 * This matches the current JTS overlay output semantics.</li>
 * <li>Another option is to fully merge output lines
 * from node to node.
 * For rings a node point is chosen arbitrarily.
 * It would also be possible to output LinearRings, 
 * if the input is a LinearRing and is unchanged.
 * This will require additional info from the input linework.</li>
 * </ul>
